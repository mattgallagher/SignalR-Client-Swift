I am looking at issues **weekly**. Urgent issues can be [**prioritized**](https://github.com/sponsors/moozzyk?frequency=one-time&sponsor=moozzyk).

My [Swift SignalR Client Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-real-time-ios-apps-with-asp-net-core-signalr) contains the most complete and up-to-date information about using the client.

Please provide the details below to avoid unnecessary turnaround:

- **Before filing an issue** - Check [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/moozzyk/SignalR-Client-Swift/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)
- **Client version** - Which version of the client are you using? Is it from Cocoapods?
- **Describe the bug** - A clear and concise description of what the bug is
- **Expected behavior** - A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
- **Enable logging at the `.debug` level and attach/past to the issue** - Attach logs captured at the `.debug` level
- **Code To Reproduce the Issue** - Show code that reproduces the issue
- **Additional context** - Add any other context about the problem (e.g. stack trace)
